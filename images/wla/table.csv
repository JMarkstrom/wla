,,,,,
DoNotFilter,"This policy setting allows a view where other third-party credential providers can also be displayed. By default, WLA filters out (do not display) any other credential provider.",,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,

The setting corresponds to the UI option (Communications tab) called Strip NETBIOS prefix (domain\username will be sent as username)",,,,
,,,,,
,[1] Strips the DOMAIN\ portion from the username when authenticating with SAS,,,,
,,,,,
,[0] WLA will not sanitize the username (default value),,,,
,,,,,
,Note: This is useful when users log in with NETBIOS sometimes and SAS username at other times and you need to sanitize what is being sent from different protected resources so that SAS can still authenticate the user(s) consistently.,,,,
WLAasV1Provider,WLAasV1Provider is used to select the Credential Provider Type and specify whether Credential Provider Type is set to V1 or not.,,,,
,,,,,
,• Windows Credential Provider Type selected as V2: WLAasV1Provider=0,,,,
,,,,,
,• Windows Credential Provider Type selected as V1: WLAasV1Provider=1,,,,
,,,,,
,"In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, it is recommended to keep the value 1 i.e. using V1 credential provider.",,,,
,,,,,
,"In Windows 8, 10, 2012, 2016, 2019, it is recommended to keep the value 0 i.e. using V2 credential provider.",,,,

ProxyPassword,"This policy setting configures the proxy server password as used when authenticating to the defined proxy server (if required), in order to connect with the token validation service (e.g. SAS or a Token Validator Proxy host). The setting corresponds to the UI option called: 'Password'.

,,,,,
,WARNING: Windows Logon Agent (WLA) uses the SAS key file to encrypt and decrypt the proxy password during operation and thus assumes the password is propagated from the GPO in encrypted form (!) To set the password with the GPO it is therefore best to retrieve it from the registry of a client already installed.,,,,
